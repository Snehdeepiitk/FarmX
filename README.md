 ## 💻 Development guidelines

1.  Put all the code in one of the existing files in  `/src`.
    
3.  Push all the code to your own branch. Once you are sure it is working, merge it with the `dev`  branch. Let's maintain only the stable and released versions on the  `master`  branch.
    
4.  Write a powerful, readable, and clean code.
